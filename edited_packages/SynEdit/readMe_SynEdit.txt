Description:

In my opinion, the default highlighter for 
Object Pascal had way to few options regarding
comments, even the three types
(Bor, Ansi and Double-Slash) were merged into
one single type.

Thus, I decided to edit the source a bit and
now you can differ into different kinds

This is intended to support the syntax I use for
comments in my projects.

Of course, this file has got a license, be aware
to act legal.

All changes I did to the file are marked with
{NEW} and {/NEW} comments.

This also can be useful, if you want to do
changes to the highlighting yourself.

Oh, and: The "new" comment-types are all valid
fpc-comments, thus they don't break any IDE
that hasn't got support for this syntax
